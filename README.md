# Room Impulse Response (RIR) Simulation using Ray Tracing

This project implements **room impulse response (RIR) generation** using **ray tracing (RT) simulation methods** in Unity.  
The goal was to simulate the way sound propagates in different room configurations and evaluate the results for use in **acoustic analysis, XR applications, and spatial audio rendering**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Construct room impulse responses (RIRs) for different room setups.
- Compare acoustic effects in furnished vs. unfurnished rooms.
- Explore ray tracing methods for accurate **acoustic simulation** in Unity.
- Provide a foundation for future **real-time auralization** in XR/VR.

## 🛠️ Features
- Unity-based implementation of **Ray Tracing (RT) simulation** for sound paths.  
- Separate scene setup for furnished and unfurnished rooms.  
- Modular project structure: Assets, Reports, and Presentations included.  
- Data visualization of simulated impulse responses.

## 🔬 Methodology
1. Defined room geometry in Unity (furnished and unfurnished).  
2. Used **ray tracing algorithms** to simulate sound reflections and energy decay.  
3. Generated Room Impulse Responses (RIRs) for both configurations.  
4. Analyzed results via:
   - Impulse response plots  
   - Decay curves  
   - Comparison between furnished vs. unfurnished spaces  

---

## 📊 Results
- Furnished rooms showed **shorter reverberation times** due to absorption.  
- Unfurnished rooms exhibited **longer reverberation** with strong reflections.  
- Visualization confirmed RT simulation effectiveness for **spatial audio studies**.
